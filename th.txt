int a = 100

2 type prog lang:
1)statically typed: c,cpp,java : 
    we ahve to define data type of variable...
2)dynamically type:
    we dont have to define data type of variable... compiler
    python,js,...


1 byte -8 bits

basic Data types in cpp

data type     size      
int            4 bytes
char           1
bool           1              true | false -- true==1 false ==0
float          4           deci..
double         8
void           0

modified data type

short int      2
unsigned int   4
long int       4 to 8
long long int  8

other data types
enum,auto,class,struct...

variable naming rules:
1st char should not be digit
only _ allowd in sp.. char
no white space are allowd
--------------------------------

OOPS:

oops main 4 pillars:
1) encapsulation
    defination : bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class.
    example: class
    use: data hiding, abstraction

    class:
    ------
    defination: a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data and methods.
              : class is collection of data members and member functions. 

    object:
    --------
    defination: an instance of a class, representing a specific entity with its own state and behavior.
              : object is instance | entity | identity  of class.          

    class       object
    veh           car
    hospitals    doctor,patient
    fruits             manago          

2) inheritance
3) polymorphism
4) abstraction

bike           



void withsraw(); defination

void withdraw(){

    //body // implment body...
}




void withdraw(a){}
void deposit(){}


void main(){


    withdraw(100) //calling part
}

constructor:
defination: const is special function which has same name as class name
1)const does not have return type
2)const can have parameters | arguments
3)const is automatically called when an object of class is created

use: to initialize object of class
    : to load data into object

    to initialize data members of class when an object is created.

type of constructor:
1) default constructor: no parameters
2) parameterized constructor: has parameters
3) copy constructor: used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.


one class must have one constructor.
if we dont define any constructor then compiler will create a default constructor for us.


inheritance:
child class can use prop of parent class this process called inheritance
but vise versa is not possible.
reuse of code
type of inheritance:
1) single inheritance: one parent one child
2) multiple inheritance: one child many parent
3) multilevel inheritance: one parent many child a-->b-->c-->d
4) hierarchical inheritance: one parent many child
5) hybrid inheritance: combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance


Parent class ---> child --> sub Child class


Electr: --> Laptop --> Gaming Laptop

paretnt class --> child classs ---> sub child [most parent]

A  --> b[a] -->x   --> c []


task:
class watch : has time function, and call function
class phone : has time function, and message function
class smartDevice
display time and and do call and do message using smartDevisce

polymorphism:
polymore means many for of the function

2 type of poly:

compile time / static binding :function overloading , operator overloading
run time poly / dynamic binding: function overriding
 
overloading:
same name of function but with diff arguments:
